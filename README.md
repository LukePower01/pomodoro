# pomodoro
A script for terminal-based terminal pomodoro timer, inspired by [bashbunni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQjJBtO-8Y&pp=ygUUY29tbWFuZGxpbmUgcG9tb2Rvcm8%3D)

## Usage
This requires ```brew install terminal-notifier``` 

I have the .sh script added to a ~/scripts directory. You will need to make sure it is executable with ```chmod +x```.  
Add the following line to your .zhrc file. 

```alias pomo="~/scripts/pomo.sh"```  

You may need to source the file ```source ~/.zshrc```, or restart your terminal.
